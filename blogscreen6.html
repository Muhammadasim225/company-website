        <h2>Target Audience:</h2>
        <br>
        <p>The first and foremost step is to learn your target audience. Who are they? What do they need? 
          Which online platforms do they usually use? Without this important information, you could be 
          shouting into the void. For example, if you are selling a product that is particularly for a 
          certain age group that does not use tik tok but you are advertising that product on tiktok, 
          chances are you will have to face difficulties in making progress because your potential customer
           does not know you even exist. Therefore, tailor your approach to resonate with your audience 
           and the platforms they frequently use.</p>

        <p><h3>Relevant Content Creation</h3>
          Once you understand your target audience, now it’s time to create some magic with your content. 
          For that, you can leverage different social media platforms including Facebook, Instagram, YouTube 
          and Tiktok, but the key is relevance. You must create content that speaks directly to the hearts 
          of your audience. People tend to buy the product from brands they resonate with, so create relevant 
          and interesting content according to the behaviour and nature of your audience. But here a question arises, 
          how often should you post? Let’s explore</p>

        <h3>How often you should post:</h3>
        <h5>Post Daily:</h5>
        Online platforms need to be maintained on a daily basis. Therefore it is necessary
         for you to post daily on your social media accounts. Furthermore, integrate your 
         accounts with each other to create a brand image and it also saves time. Always 
         post high quality images, videos and short reels for better customer engagement 
         and brand persona. This helps build trust among customers regarding your product or services.
         <h5>Engage with your potential customers</h5>
         The idea is not just about posting daily, it is also important to engage with your customers properly.
          The more you engage with people in the comment section, the higher are the chances to get organic traffic.
           It also creates a sense of authenticity of your business among people.
        <h5>Answer their Queries promptly</h5>
        We tend to buy from those who respond promptly. So, online businesses should understand that a person in the
         inbox or in the comment section asking a question can be your potential customer. So, always answer their 
         queries with respect and dignity in a timely manner.
         <h5>Welcome their feedback and try to improvise</h5>
         Businesses that follow the latest trends and evolve with time are able to increase their sales in contrast to their competitors. Therefore, always listen to the feedback of your customers and strive to improve your products / services accordingly.
